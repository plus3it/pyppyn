Pyppyn helps you dynamically read setup configurations and load dependencies.

Since ``pip`` is excellent at reading setup configurations and loading dependencies, why Pyppyn?
If you need programmatic access to dependency information, for
example, in dynamically creating standalone
applications using `GravityBee <https://github.com/YakDriver/gravitybee>`_ and `PyInstaller <http://www.pyinstaller.org>`_, Pyppyn can help you out.

Pyppyn can be used in scripts or using the CLI. Either way, it can be
installed easily.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install pyppyn

CLI
===

``Pyppyn`` will display help in typical fashion.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pyppyn --help

Example
=======

To parse the included test mini Python package (tests/minipippy),
with a setup.cfg and setup.py file, and install the required
dependencies, you can use this command. This allows you to install
dependencies without installing the package.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pyppyn --setup-path tests/minipippy --platform linux -v -a

From Python
===========

This is a sample usage of Pyppyn from a Python script.

.. code-block:: python

    import pyppyn

    # Create an instance
    p = pyppyn.ConfigRep(setup_path="tests/minipippy")

    # Load config, install dependencies and import a module from the package
    p.process_config()

    print("Package requires:", p.get_required())

Namesake
========

This module is named in
honor of Pippin, a companion, friend, Bichon Frise-Shih Tzu mix. He
passed away on March 30, 2018 at the age of 12 after a battle with
diabetes, blindness, deafness, and loss of smell. Pleasant to the
end, he was a great, great dog.
